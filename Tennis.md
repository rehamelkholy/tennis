You are welcome to use this coding environment to train your agent for the project.  Follow the instructions below to get started!

### 1. Start the Environment

Run the next code cell to install a few packages.  This line will take a few minutes to run!


```python
!pip -q install ./python
```

    [31mtensorflow 1.7.1 has requirement numpy>=1.13.3, but you'll have numpy 1.12.1 which is incompatible.[0m
    [31mipython 6.5.0 has requirement prompt-toolkit<2.0.0,>=1.0.15, but you'll have prompt-toolkit 2.0.9 which is incompatible.[0m


The environment is already saved in the Workspace and can be accessed at the file path provided below. 


```python
from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
import numpy as np

env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="/data/Tennis_Linux_NoVis/Tennis")
```

    INFO:unityagents:
    'Academy' started successfully!
    Unity Academy name: Academy
            Number of Brains: 1
            Number of External Brains : 1
            Lesson number : 0
            Reset Parameters :
    		
    Unity brain name: TennisBrain
            Number of Visual Observations (per agent): 0
            Vector Observation space type: continuous
            Vector Observation space size (per agent): 8
            Number of stacked Vector Observation: 3
            Vector Action space type: continuous
            Vector Action space size (per agent): 2
            Vector Action descriptions: , 


Environments contain **_brains_** which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. Here we check for the first brain available, and set it as the default brain we will be controlling from Python.


```python
# get the default brain
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]
```

### 2. Examine the State and Action Spaces

Run the code cell below to print some information about the environment.


```python
# reset the environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# number of agents 
num_agents = len(env_info.agents)
print('Number of agents:', num_agents)

# size of each action
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size
print('Size of each action:', action_size)

# examine the state space 
states = env_info.vector_observations
state_size = states.shape[1]
print('There are {} agents. Each observes a state with length: {}'.format(states.shape[0], state_size))
print('The state for the first agent looks like:', states[0])
```

    Number of agents: 2
    Size of each action: 2
    There are 2 agents. Each observes a state with length: 24
    The state for the first agent looks like: [ 0.          0.          0.          0.          0.          0.          0.
      0.          0.          0.          0.          0.          0.          0.
      0.          0.         -6.65278625 -1.5        -0.          0.
      6.83172083  6.         -0.          0.        ]


### 3. Take Random Actions in the Environment

In the next code cell, you will learn how to use the Python API to control the agent and receive feedback from the environment.

Note that **in this coding environment, you will not be able to watch the agents while they are training**, and you should set `train_mode=True` to restart the environment.


```python
for i in range(5):                                         # play game for 5 episodes
    env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name]     # reset the environment    
    states = env_info.vector_observations                  # get the current state (for each agent)
    scores = np.zeros(num_agents)                          # initialize the score (for each agent)
    while True:
        actions = np.random.randn(num_agents, action_size) # select an action (for each agent)
        actions = np.clip(actions, -1, 1)                  # all actions between -1 and 1
        env_info = env.step(actions)[brain_name]           # send all actions to tne environment
        next_states = env_info.vector_observations         # get next state (for each agent)
        rewards = env_info.rewards                         # get reward (for each agent)
        dones = env_info.local_done                        # see if episode finished
        scores += env_info.rewards                         # update the score (for each agent)
        states = next_states                               # roll over states to next time step
        if np.any(dones):                                  # exit loop if episode finished
            break
    print('Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: {}'.format(np.mean(scores)))
```

    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: -0.004999999888241291
    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: 0.04500000085681677
    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: -0.004999999888241291
    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: -0.004999999888241291
    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: -0.004999999888241291


When finished, you can close the environment.


```python
#env.close()
```

### 4. It's Your Turn!

Now it's your turn to train your own agent to solve the environment!  A few **important notes**:
- When training the environment, set `train_mode=True`, so that the line for resetting the environment looks like the following:
```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]
```
- To structure your work, you're welcome to work directly in this Jupyter notebook, or you might like to start over with a new file!  You can see the list of files in the workspace by clicking on **_Jupyter_** in the top left corner of the notebook.
- In this coding environment, you will not be able to watch the agents while they are training.  However, **_after training the agents_**, you can download the saved model weights to watch the agents on your own machine! 

#### 4.1. Import the Necessary Packages

brain = env.brains[brain_name]

# reset the environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# number of agents 
num_agents = len(env_info.agents)

# size of each action
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size

# examine the state space 
states = env_info.vector_observations
state_size = states.shape[1]

#### 4.8. Train the Agent


```python
scores = maddpg()
```

    Episode 100	Average Score: 0.005	Maximum Score: 0.100
    Episode 200	Average Score: 0.005	Maximum Score: 0.100
    Episode 300	Average Score: 0.012	Maximum Score: 0.200
    Episode 400	Average Score: 0.007	Maximum Score: 0.200
    Episode 500	Average Score: 0.035	Maximum Score: 0.200
    Episode 600	Average Score: 0.044	Maximum Score: 0.100
    Episode 700	Average Score: 0.046	Maximum Score: 0.100
    Episode 800	Average Score: 0.050	Maximum Score: 0.100
    Episode 900	Average Score: 0.131	Maximum Score: 0.600
    Episode 1000	Average Score: 0.289	Maximum Score: 1.800
    Episode 1030	Average Score: 0.513	Maximum Score: 2.600
     Environment solved in 930 episodes!	Average Score: 0.51


#### 4.9. Visulaize the Results


```python
# plot the scores
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
plt.plot(np.arange(len(scores)), scores)
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.xlabel('Episode #')
plt.show()
```

#### 4.10. Load the Checkpoint


```python
# load the weights from file
agent.actor_local.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoint_actor.pth'))
agent.critic_local.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoint_critic.pth'))
```

#### 4.11. Evaluate the Agent


```python
for i in range(5):                                         # play game for 5 episodes
    env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name]     # reset the environment    
    states = env_info.vector_observations                  # get the current state (for each agent)
    scores = np.zeros(num_agents)                          # initialize the score (for each agent)
    while True:
        agent.reset()
        actions = agent.act(states)
        env_info = env.step(actions)[brain_name]           # send all actions to tne environment
        next_states = env_info.vector_observations         # get next state (for each agent)
        rewards = env_info.rewards                         # get reward (for each agent)
        dones = env_info.local_done                        # see if episode finished
        scores += env_info.rewards                         # update the score (for each agent)
        states = next_states                               # roll over states to next time step
        if np.any(dones):                                  # exit loop if episode finished
            break
    print('Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: {}'.format(np.mean(scores)))
```

    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: 2.600000038743019
    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: 2.600000038743019

#### 4.12. Close the Environment


```python
env.close()
```
